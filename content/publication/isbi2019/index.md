abstract: "This paper considers automatic clinical workflow description
of full-length routine fetal anomaly ultrasound scans using
deep learning approaches for spatio-temporal video analysis.
Multiple architectures consisting of 2D and 2D + t CNN,
LSTM, and convolutional LSTM are investigated and compared. The contributions of short-term and long-term temporal changes are studied, and a multi-stream framework analysis is found to achieve the best top-1 accuracy=0.77 and top-3
accuracy=0.94. Automated partitioning and characterisation
on unlabelled full-length video scans show high correlation
(œÅ=0.95, p=0.0004) with workflow statistics of manually labelled videos, suggesting practicality of proposed methods."
