abstract: "For visual tasks like ultrasound (US) scanning, experts direct their gaze towards regions of task-relevant information. Therefore,
learning to predict the gaze of sonographers on US videos captures the
spatio-temporal patterns that are important for US scanning. The spatial
distribution of gaze points on video frames can be represented through
heat maps termed saliency maps. Here, we propose a temporally bidirectional model for video saliency prediction (BDS-Net), drawing inspiration
from modern theories of human cognition. The model consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder followed by a bidirectional gated-
recurrent-unit recurrent convolutional network (GRU-RCN) decoder. The
temporal bidirectionality mimics human cognition, which simultaneously
reacts to past and predicts future sensory inputs. We train the BDS-Net
alongside spatial and temporally one-directional comparative models on
the task of predicting saliency in videos of US abdominal circumference
plane detection. The BDS-Net outperforms the comparative models on
four out of five saliency metrics. We present a qualitative analysis on
representative examples to explain the modelâ€™s superior performance."
